I can help you find where the instructor talks about data in the videos.

The instructor mentions "big data analysis" and talks about Python being the language of choice for this, so let's look at that video. 

The relevant part is from 'Python in 100 Seconds', starting at 00:29 and ending at 00:33. The instructor explains how Python is used for big data analysis with popular frameworks like Django.
